## Problem Statement
In todayâ€™s fast-paced world, finding reliable and compatible sports partners can be challenging.

Think Tinder meets Meetup, but hyper-focused on sports enthusiasts. Users can find partners to play with, organize games, discover new sports venues, and build an active community. AthLink will gamify social sports interactions with leaderboards, ratings, and reviews to encourage reliability and engagement.
